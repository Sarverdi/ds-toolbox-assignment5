# Definition: git status


Git status command shows the state of the working directory and the staging area. It gives us all about the current state of the local Git repository.
It is recommended to run before any "git add" or "git commit" command. 

It allows us to see :

     Current branch (what branch we're on)
     The new files that are not being tracked by Git that are displaying under the "Untracked files" section.
     The edited-files that are not being staged that are displaying under the "Changes not staged for commit" section.
     The staged changes that are displaying under the "Changes to be committed" section.

This command will not show any commit records.
